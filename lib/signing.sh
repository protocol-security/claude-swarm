# Git SSH commit-signing config, driven by file existence.
#
# When the source key exists, copy it to a swarm-owned scratch
# location with 0600 perms and point git at the copy.  ssh-keygen
# -Y sign refuses world-readable keys with "UNPROTECTED PRIVATE
# KEY FILE", and the bind-mounted /etc/swarm/signing_key inherits
# host perms (often 0644 for shared swarm-bot keys).  Without
# this copy, signing fails inside the container, and Codex CLI
# reacts by silently passing --no-gpg-sign on its retry
# (openai/codex#6199), so commits land without a signature.
#
# The destination lives outside $HOME on purpose.  $HOME is the
# agent's namespace, not the harness's.  Default is /dev/shm
# (tmpfs, RAM-backed, per-container in Docker) so the private
# key bytes never hit disk; 0600 perms keep it from any other
# UID that might run alongside the agent in the same container.
#
# Sourced by lib/harness.sh inside the container (source key
# at /etc/swarm/signing_key) and by tests/test_harness.sh with
# a sandbox path.
