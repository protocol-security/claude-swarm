# Shared helpers for driver implementations.
#
# Drivers that emit the standard JSONL format (with a "result" line
# containing usage stats) can delegate agent_extract_stats to
# _extract_jsonl_stats rather than reimplementing the same parsing.
#
# Drivers that shell out to an external CLI and pipe its stdout to
# the activity-filter pipeline MUST use _run_reaped to execute the
# CLI (see below for why).
#
# Usage in a driver file:
#   source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/_common.sh"
#   agent_extract_stats() { _extract_jsonl_stats "$1"; }
#   agent_run() { _run_reaped "$logfile" cli --arg ... "$prompt"; }

# Activity watchdog for _run_reaped.
#
# Polls <logfile>'s mtime every $SWARM_ACTIVITY_POLL seconds
# (default 10).  If it hasn't advanced for <timeout> seconds while
# the CLI is still alive, SIGTERM the CLI's process group; if the
# group doesn't exit within $SWARM_WATCHDOG_GRACE seconds (default
# 10) SIGKILL it.  This catches the case `_run_reaped` alone
# cannot: the CLI itself is alive but deadlocked internally
# (inside a model request, a long-running MCP tool, or an I/O
# wait), so `wait "$_cmd_pid"` never returns and the post-wait
# group-kill never runs.  Without this, the harness sits on the
# `| tee` pipe indefinitely and only an external `docker stop`
# recovers the container.
#
# Activated only when $SWARM_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT is a positive
# integer; 0 (the default) disables the watchdog, preserving the
# pre-0.20.5 behaviour for operators who haven't opted in.  The
# two tunables ($SWARM_ACTIVITY_POLL, $SWARM_WATCHDOG_GRACE) are
# defaulted to production-sensible values; tests override them to
# keep the behavioural suite under a few seconds.
#
# The mtime probe uses GNU `stat -c %Y` with a BSD `stat -f %m`
# fallback so the helper is runnable on stock macOS CI runners
# too, even though it only meaningfully fires inside the Linux
# production container.

# Run an external CLI in its own process group, tee its stdout to
# <logfile>, redirect its stderr to <logfile>.err, and propagate its
# exit code.  After the CLI's main process exits, SIGKILL the entire
# process group so any surviving descendants release their FDs.
#
# Args: <logfile> <cmd> [args...]
#
# WHY PROCESS GROUPS:
#   Agent CLIs (codex, claude, gemini) commonly spawn helper
#   subprocesses -- MCP servers, subagents, reasoning workers, IPC
#   brokers -- that inherit the parent's stdout.  When the CLI's
#   main process exits without waiting for those children, the
#   children keep the pipe to `tee` open, `tee` never sees EOF, and
#   the entire downstream `| /activity-filter.sh` pipeline wedges
#   indefinitely.  The harness blocks on the pipe and no progress
#   is made until the container is externally killed.
#
#   `setsid` gives the CLI a fresh session/process group (pgid =
#   cmd_pid), so every descendant it forks inherits that pgid.
#   After `wait` returns, `kill -KILL -- -$cmd_pid` signals the
#   entire group, forcing any lingering descendant to exit and
#   release its pipe FD.  The downstream pipeline then observes
#   EOF and drains cleanly.
#
# WHY AN ACTIVITY WATCHDOG:
#   The process-group kill only fires after `wait "$_cmd_pid"`
#   returns.  If the CLI itself is alive but deadlocked (long-
#   running MCP tool, stuck model request, blocked I/O), `wait`
#   blocks forever and the group-kill never runs -- empirically
#   observed as "silence for 4h22m until external docker stop"
#   on codex-cli swarms.  Setting SWARM_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT to a
#   positive integer enables `_reap_watchdog` above, which
#   SIGTERMs the CLI's process group after that many seconds of
#   logfile staleness and falls through to SIGKILL after another
#   10 seconds.  Default 0 (disabled); 300-600 is a good starting
#   point for production codex-cli / claude-code swarms.
#
# EXIT STATUS:
#   Returns the CLI's wait-reported exit code (128+N for signalled
#   exits), preserved across the tee pipe via PIPESTATUS.
#
# PORTABILITY:
#   `stdbuf` and `setsid` are GNU utilities (coreutils / util-linux).
#   They're always present on the production target (the
#   debian:bookworm-slim container), but stock macOS ships neither.
#   To keep unit tests runnable on non-Linux CI runners we degrade
#   gracefully when either is absent:
#     - no stdbuf -> bare `tee` (same fallback `fake.sh` uses);
#     - no setsid -> run the command in-line and skip the group kill.
#   The setsid fallback effectively disables the zombie-reaping
#   protection, but that protection only matters inside the
#   production container where setsid is always available.
